Hello there! ðŸ‘‹ My name is Victor Hugo, and I am a passionate QA Engineer with five years of experience in Front-end automation using tools like Selenium and Cypress.

ðŸ”­ Currently, I am working on a new project that involves using Selenium with Python and the latest Python libraries.

ðŸŒ± I am also continuously learning about TypeScript, Playwright, and the newest Safari Webkit to stay up-to-date with the latest trends in automation.

ðŸ‘¯ I am looking to collaborate on a full API project to create new mapping and scenario testing to achieve full application API coverage.

ðŸ¤” I am also eager to help the QA community more by spreading the word about automation and its benefits.

ðŸ’¬ Feel free to ask me about how to improve your code patterns, and I will be glad to help. ðŸ˜Š
